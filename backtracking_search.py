# each variable one of two stars in col
# D_i = {1..(maxCol*2)}
# OR
# each variable is one of two stars in region, algorithm would take region boundres as input

# constraints
# star from same region have different locations 
# no two touch from any region
# only two othe star in same row / col from any region
